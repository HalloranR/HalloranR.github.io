            <section>
                <p>Greetings, I am Riley Halloran, a Technical Designer and Gameplay Programmer currently working at NSWC Crane. I recently graduated Indiana Univertsity with a MS in 
                    Computer Science and a BS in game design. I also published an independant game with a team of students called Erin and the Otherworld. </p>

                <section>
                    <p>This is a game I am currently working on with a team of fellow students. A Celtic themed, constellation drawing, rouge-lite card game where the player as Erin set about sealing the Otherworld to protect their home.

                <p>As lead programmer for the game I had to balance a lot. My work focused mostly
                    on
                    implementing features for the game like
                    a state machine, constellation drawing elements, and designing the project structure for the team. I worked
                    in
                    tandem with the team to communicate tasks between the programmers and designers. 
                    During development I maintained code-writing-conventions in addition to writing documentation. Examples of my work can be seen following the title link.  </p>

                    <p>This is a cancelled project that me and a team of 4 were developing for 5 months. The game is a single
                        player
                        "yank-and-slash" rogue like where the player uses a grappling hook to pull around friendly
                        companions in order to defeat an eldritch threat. My position for this game was the head programmer
                        where I produced all the code and gameplay elements in the project. </p>
