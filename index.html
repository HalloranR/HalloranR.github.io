					<div class="five columns D1"> <h5> Text Adventure Project </h5>
						<p> Welcome to my Text Adventure Project, "Escape the Meridian". This game's location story and structure was made by me using python and some json files. My professor provided a structure based on the famous text adventure game "Zork" but this base has been heavily modified to suit the needs of my game. You can find a link to my gitHub <a href="https://github.com/rifhall/02-Text-adventure" > here </a> where you can download the game for yourself. </p> </div>
