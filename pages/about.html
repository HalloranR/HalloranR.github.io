                    <p>Growing up I always had a big passion for games.
                        In the past me and my sibilings would all sit and take turns playing on our GameCube, watching
                        eachother and taking turns.
                        As a result I knew I wanted to be a video game programmer and make the kind of games that bring
                        people and communities together. </p>
                    <p>My other hobbies include log rolling, swimming, stained glass, board games, history podcasts, and
                        nature.</p>

                <h2>My Education</h2>
                <p>For college I go to Indiana University, where I will graduate spring 2023. At IU I have been working
                    hard to develop my skills.
                    for my Undergraduate degree I decided early on to double major with a BS in Computer Science
                    (Specialization: AI) and in Game Design (Specialization: programmer).
                    I have tacked on two minors in Informatics and Mathematics to round out my skills.
                    After completing my CS degree, I moved on to an accelerated master's program where I will finish my
                    education with a Ms in Computer Science.</p>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>All of my jobs that I have worked while in college have been training me in communication and
                    management. At the moment I am a swim coach for a local team called Indiana Swim Club (ISC).
                    My time there has been spent coaching kid in the range all the way from elementary school to
                    high school. Every day I make sure to choose my works carefully in order to explain how each
                    participant can improve.
                    This can be challenging in a group setting where children can disruptive and unresponsive but I do
                    my best to keep the chaos under control.
                    My one on one communication has been bolstered from my many years working for IU RecSports as a Swim
                    Instructor. In this role I train people in private lessons where I construct a workout and guide the
                    participant through.
                    This position sees me teaching individuals ranging from children to adults how to swim.
                    Lastly, I held the position of an Residential Assistant (RA) at IU during Covid19. While this role
                    was stressful, it taught me a lot and gave me a chance to practice setting rules and expectations
                    for everyone.
                    Because of Covid, there were often policy changes from on high that I would have to implement in my
                    day to day position. All of these jobs have honed my communication and management to a fine point
                    and I feel confident in whatever role I take next.
